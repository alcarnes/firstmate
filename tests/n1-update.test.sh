# Tests for bin/n1-update.sh: fast-forward-only self-update of a running
# numberone repo and every registered lieutenant home.
#
# The guarantees under test mirror n1-fleet-sync.sh and prime directive #3:
#   - The running numberone repo (on its default branch) fast-forwards from
#     origin; a leased lieutenant home (detached HEAD on the default branch)
#     fast-forwards the same way.
#   - FAST-FORWARD ONLY: a dirty, diverged, offline, or wrong-branch target is
#     skipped and reported, never forced or stashed, so unlanded work survives.
#   - The update is a single-parent fast-forward (never a merge commit) and a
#     fast-forward of one worktree never disturbs another worktree's checkout
#     or the shared default branch.
#   - The caller-action summary is correct: reread-numberone flips to yes only
#     when the instruction surface (AGENTS.md / bin / skills) changed, and
#     nudge-lieutenants lists exactly the live lieutenants that advanced.
#   - Lieutenant homes resolve from both state/<id>.meta and the
#     data/lieutenants.md registry, deduped, and the numberone repo is never
#     re-processed as one of its own lieutenants.
